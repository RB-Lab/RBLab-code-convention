# General things

## File names
1. **No spaces in file names**. It can be hard to call such file in command line. 
2. **Don't use upper-case in file name**. We love CamelCase but some files systems are case insensitive so git 
have default pre-set `ignorecase = true`. It can lead to very mysterious bugs in your repo.

## Text formatting
1. **Use tabs instead of whitespace for indent**. First of all tabs are intended for that thing. Second, if you prefer indentation equals to 3 character you can use settings for that in your IDE or editor. And only you will see it as 3 whitespace. Otherwise everyone will get your code with 3 whitespace and will have to adapt his habits to yours.
2. **80 characters length of the line**. Is preferred but do not be too bully about it.
